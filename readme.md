# Ghost Counter

A [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod that allows you to select an area and conveniently get a list
of all the ghost entities and tiles within that area, sorted by count. The mod will also show you
how many of each item/tile you currently have in your inventory and how many you're missing. For
each item/tile that you're missing, you can make a one-time logistic request for the amount you
need. Your previous logistic request (if any) will be restored once that one-time request has been
fulfilled.

Use the mod selection tool by clicking on the ghost shortcut button in your toolbar or by using the
keyboard shortcut (default Ctrl + G). Next, select the area containing the ghosts that you want to
count. Holding shift during selection will include ghost tiles in the count.

You can download it from the Factorio
[Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ghost-counter).
