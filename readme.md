# Ghost Counter

A [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod that allows you to select an area and conveniently get a list
of all the ghost entities and tiles within that area, sorted by count. The mod will also show you
how many of each item/tile you currently have in your inventory and how many you're missing. For
each item/tile that you're missing, you can set a temporary logistic request for the amount you
need. Your previous logistic request (if any) will be restored once that request has been
fulfilled.

Use the mod selection tool by clicking on the ghost shortcut button in your shortcut bar or by using
the keyboard shortcut (default: Alt+G). Next, select the area containing the ghosts that you want
to count. Holding shift during selection will include ghost tiles in the count.

You can use the mod directly on blueprints by having the blueprint in your cursor and pressing the
second configurable mod hotkey (default: Ctrl+G).

You can download it from the Factorio
[Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ghost-counter).
